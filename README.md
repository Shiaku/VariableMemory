# VariableMemory
A memory game with variable formats and rules.

This project was made to be delivered for a university class assignment.

The assignment was to implement a project where more than 4 design patterns were applied.

The my idea was to recreate the 'Genius' memory game, but adding some new rules and layouts, making the mechanic more flexible and interesting.
To implement these rules and layouts in a generic manner, many patterns were used. 
My focus was in the use of Factory/Builder to manage the creation of the selected rules and layouts, while the ingame manager would apply them generically through facade application.
As the project advanced, new ideas came up such as making each button have it's own different effect on the screen/layout and that lead into the use of command.

There are still many ideas to be implemented, but this will depend on my free time.

Thanks for reading this and hope you have some fun playing the game.
